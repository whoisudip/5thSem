**2. Explain C2C and B2B e-commerce models with example. [2.5+2.5]**

*   **C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer):** This model facilitates transactions directly between individual consumers through an online platform. The platform provider typically earns revenue via listing fees, commissions, or advertisements. It empowers individuals to buy from and sell to each other.
    *   *Example:* **OLX Nepal or eBay.** An individual sells their used bicycle to another individual via the OLX platform. OLX connects the buyer and seller but isn't directly involved in owning the product.
*   **B2B (Business-to-Business):** This model involves transactions where both the buyer and seller are businesses. These transactions often involve larger order volumes, negotiated pricing, and may include raw materials, wholesale goods, or specialized services integral to business operations.
    *   *Example:* **Alibaba.com.** A furniture manufacturer in Nepal sources bulk quantities of wood or hardware supplies from an international supplier listed on Alibaba. The transaction is between two businesses.

**3. What is M-Commerce? Explain its benefits for organization, individual and society. [2+3]**

**6. What is digital signature? Explain the requirements of digital signature in secure transaction. How does digital signature work? [2+1+2]**

*   **Digital Signature:** A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that provides a digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, but offering far more inherent security. It mathematically binds the identity of a signer to a specific electronic document or message and ensures that the content has not been altered since it was signed.
*   **Requirements for Secure Transactions:**
    *   **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the signer (non-repudiation).
    *   **Integrity:** Guarantees that the signed content has not been changed after signing.
*   **How it Works (Simplified):**
    1.  **Hashing:** The sender's software calculates a unique fixed-size string of characters (a hash) from the original message/document using a mathematical function (like SHA-256). Any change to the document changes the hash drastically.
    2.  **Signing:** The sender encrypts this hash value using their **private key**. This encrypted hash is the **digital signature**.
    3.  **Sending:** The sender transmits the original message/document along with the digital signature.
    4.  **Verification:** The recipient:
        *   Calculates a new hash of the received original message using the same function.
        *   Decrypts the received digital signature using the sender's publicly available **public key**. This reveals the original hash value the sender generated.
        *   Compares the newly calculated hash with the decrypted original hash.
    5.  **Result:** If the two hashes match exactly, it proves:
        *   **Integrity:** The message was not altered in transit.
        *   **Authenticity:** The message was signed by the holder of the corresponding private key (the claimed sender).

**7. Explain cryptocurrency with its legal provisions in Nepal. How is it different from virtual currency? [3+2]**

*   **Cryptocurrency:** Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security, making it difficult to counterfeit. It operates on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers (nodes). It is not issued or controlled by any central bank or government authority (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
*   **Legal Provisions in Nepal:** As per directives issued by the **Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB)**, the central bank of Nepal, dealing in cryptocurrencies is **illegal**. The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1962, has been interpreted to prohibit the buying, selling, or exchanging of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. NRB has explicitly warned the public that such activities are against the law and pose significant financial risks.
*   **Difference from Virtual Currency:**
    *   **Cryptocurrency:** A specific subset of virtual currency characterized by decentralization (no central issuer/controller), use of cryptography, and operation on a blockchain or distributed ledger. Its value is determined by market forces (supply and demand). (e.g., Bitcoin).
    *   **Virtual Currency:** A broader term encompassing any digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, but is *not* legal tender. It *can* be centralized (issued and controlled by a single entity). Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies, but not all virtual currencies are cryptocurrencies. Examples include:
        *   Centralized virtual currencies: In-game tokens (e.g., V-Bucks in Fortnite), loyalty points issued by a company.
        *   Decentralized virtual currencies: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

**8. What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? Explain the importance of SEO for the growth of a website. [3+2]**

*   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** SEO is the practice of optimizing a website and its content to increase its visibility and ranking in the unpaid, organic results pages of search engines (like Google, Bing). It involves technical adjustments, content creation/optimization, and building website authority to make the site more attractive and relevant to search engines for specific keywords or phrases.
*   **Importance for Website Growth:**
    1.  **Increased Organic Traffic:** Higher rankings for relevant keywords lead to significantly more visitors discovering the website naturally through search engines, which is often the largest source of traffic for many sites.
    2.  **Builds Credibility and Trust:** Websites ranking highly on search engines are generally perceived by users as more credible, trustworthy, and authoritative within their field.
    3.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** While SEO requires effort and resources, it provides a sustainable source of "free" traffic over time, unlike paid advertising which stops when the budget stops.
    4.  **Better User Experience:** SEO best practices (site speed, mobile-friendliness, clear navigation, quality content) inherently improve the experience for all website visitors.
    5.  **Foundation for Other Marketing:** High organic visibility supports other marketing efforts (social media, content marketing, PR) and provides a steady stream of potential customers.

**Group C: Attempting Questions 10 and 11 (Two Questions)**

**10. “The use of electronic payment systems has significantly increased in Nepal in recent years”. In this context, explain the trend of cashless transaction in Nepal along with the benefits and downsides of digital payment systems and cashless economy.**

    *   **Privacy Concerns:** Increased potential for surveillance and tracking of financial transactions by governments, corporations, or malicious actors.
    *   **Transaction Costs:** Fees associated with some digital transactions (merchant fees, transfer fees) can be burdensome, especially for small vendors or low-value transactions.
    *   **Overspending Risk:** The ease of digital spending can sometimes lead to reduced financial discipline and impulse buying.
    *   **Infrastructure Dependency:** Requires robust nationwide telecommunications and electricity infrastructure, which can be lacking in remote areas.

**11. How can you evaluate whether the proposed e-commerce project is feasible or not. What can be the different funding techniques for a fresh graduate to setup a new online business? Explain. [3+7]**

*   **Evaluating E-commerce Project Feasibility:**
    A thorough feasibility study assesses viability across key dimensions:
    1.  **Technical Feasibility:**
        *   Can the required technology (website platform, payment gateway, inventory management, security) be acquired, implemented, and maintained?
        *   Is the necessary technical expertise available in-house or outsourced?
        *   Are there any significant technical hurdles or risks?
    2.  **Economic/Financial Feasibility:**
        *   **Cost Analysis:** Estimate all startup costs (website development, inventory, licenses, marketing) and ongoing operational costs (hosting, payment fees, salaries, marketing, logistics).
        *   **Revenue Projections:** Forecast sales based on market size, target audience, pricing strategy, and competition analysis. Be realistic and conservative.
        *   **Profitability Analysis:** Calculate projected profit margins and conduct a Break-Even Analysis (when will revenue cover costs?).
        *   **Return on Investment (ROI):** Estimate the financial returns compared to the investment required. Does the projected ROI justify the risk?
        *   **Cash Flow Projection:** Ensure the business can generate enough cash to meet its obligations, especially in the early stages.
    3.  **Market Feasibility:**
        *   **Target Market:** Clearly define the target audience. Is it large enough?
        *   **Market Need:** Is there a genuine demand or problem the project solves? Validate through surveys, competitor analysis, or MVP testing.
        *   **Competition:** Analyze direct and indirect competitors. What is the competitive advantage (Unique Selling Proposition - USP)?
        *   **Market Trends:** Are market trends favorable for this type of e-commerce business?
    4.  **Operational/Organizational Feasibility:**
        *   Can the necessary operational processes (sourcing, inventory management, order fulfillment, customer service, returns) be effectively established and managed?
        *   Is the required human resource (skills, availability) accessible?
        *   Are there suitable suppliers and logistics partners?
        *   Does the management team have the necessary skills and experience?

*   **Funding Techniques for a Fresh Graduate:**
    Securing funding as a new graduate requires creativity and resourcefulness:
    1.  **Bootstrapping / Personal Savings:** Using your own savings or income from a side job. Offers complete control but limits scale and carries personal financial risk. Essential for very early stages.
    2.  **Friends and Family (F&F):** Raising funds from relatives or close friends. Often based on trust rather than formal business plans. Crucial to have clear agreements (loans or equity) to avoid relationship strain.
    3.  **Business Plan Competitions / Grants:** Participating in university or entrepreneurship competitions that offer prize money. Researching government or NGO grants specifically for youth entrepreneurship or specific sectors (e.g., tech, agriculture).
    4.  **Crowdfunding:**
        *   **Rewards-based (e.g., Kickstarter, Indiegogo):** Pre-selling products or offering unique rewards in exchange for pledges. Validates market interest but requires a compelling pitch and marketing effort.
        *   **Equity-based (less common for grads):** Offering small equity stakes to a large pool of investors via platforms (regulated and less prevalent in Nepal).
    5.  **Angel Investors:** Affluent individuals who invest their own money in early-stage startups, often in exchange for equity. They may also provide mentorship and connections. Finding angels requires networking and a strong pitch deck. More accessible than VCs for smaller amounts.
    6.  **Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) / Small Loans:** Accessing small business loans specifically designed for entrepreneurs, potentially with lower collateral requirements than traditional banks (e.g., loans from institutions like Nirdhan Utthan, some cooperative societies). Interest rates can be higher.
    7.  **Bank Loans (Challenging):** Applying for a traditional business loan from a bank. This typically requires a solid business plan, collateral (which graduates often lack), credit history, and sometimes a co-signer. Can be difficult for very new businesses without assets.
    8.  **Pre-sales / Customer Deposits:** Generating initial capital by taking orders and deposits before the product is fully ready or inventory is purchased. Validates demand and provides working capital.
    9.  **Partnerships:** Bringing on a partner who contributes capital in exchange for equity or profit sharing. Combines resources and skills but requires careful agreement on roles and responsibilities.
    ***(For a Fresh Graduate):*** Prioritize bootstrapping, F&F, competitions/grants, and potentially MFI loans initially. Crowdfunding and angel investment become viable with a strong prototype/MVP and clear market validation. Networking within university incubators or startup communities is crucial.

**Attempting Questions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 (Six Questions)**

**2. How properties like ubiquity, richness and information density make e-commerce better than traditional commerce? [5]**

E-commerce possesses distinct properties that offer significant advantages over traditional commerce:

1.  **Ubiquity:** E-commerce is available *everywhere, anytime*. The marketspace is not constrained by physical location or operating hours. Customers can shop or transact 24/7 from any internet-connected device (home, work, mobile).
    *   *Advantage over Traditional:* Removes geographical barriers and time constraints, vastly expanding market reach and customer convenience compared to physical stores with fixed locations and hours.

2.  **Richness:** This refers to the **depth and detail** of information that can be provided to the customer. E-commerce platforms can offer rich multimedia content (videos, high-res images, 360° views, interactive demos), detailed specifications, user reviews, comparisons, and personalized recommendations.
    *   *Advantage over Traditional:* Far exceeds the informational richness possible through physical brochures, shelf tags, or even salesperson explanations. Empowers customers with comprehensive product understanding.

3.  **Information Density:** The total amount and quality of information available to all market participants (buyers, sellers) is vastly greater and more accessible in e-commerce. Information becomes plentiful, cheaper, and more accurate. Search engines and comparison tools allow instant access to prices, features, and reviews across multiple vendors.
    *   *Advantage over Traditional:* Reduces information asymmetry. Customers can easily find the best deals and most suitable products. Sellers gain deeper insights into customer behavior through analytics. Transaction costs (searching for information, buyers, sellers) are significantly lowered.

**Collectively,** these properties make e-commerce more efficient, convenient, informative, and accessible, leading to greater market transparency, lower costs, enhanced customer experience, and broader market participation compared to traditional brick-and-mortar commerce.

**3. Differentiate B2C, B2B and C2C e-commerce with examples. [5]**

    *   **Examples:** A garment factory sourcing fabric from an international supplier via Alibaba.com, Microsoft selling Office 365 licenses to a bank, a logistics company providing services to an e-commerce platform.

*   **C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer):**
    *   **Definition:** Transactions where individual consumers sell products or services directly to other individual consumers, facilitated by an online platform.
    *   **Focus:** Connecting individuals, enabling the sale of used goods or personal services, peer-to-peer exchange.
    *   **Examples:** Selling a used bicycle on Hamrobazaar.com, renting out a room on Airbnb (individual host to individual guest), selling handmade crafts on Etsy (individual artisan to individual buyer).

**4. What is the role of information superhighway in e-commerce? List the components of information superhighway. [2+3]**

*   **Role in E-commerce:**
    The information superhighway (a metaphor for the global, high-speed telecommunications infrastructure) is the **fundamental enabler** of e-commerce. It provides the essential network backbone that allows:
    *   Seamless global connectivity between businesses, consumers, and systems.
    *   High-speed transmission of vast amounts of data (product info, transactions, multimedia).
    *   Real-time communication and interaction essential for online transactions.
    *   Access to e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, and services from anywhere.
    *   Support for complex applications like secure payment gateways and inventory management systems. Without this robust infrastructure, modern e-commerce as we know it would not exist.

*   **Components of the Information Superhighway:**
    1.  **High-Speed Telecommunication Networks:** Fiber optic cables, satellite links, cellular networks (4G/5G), providing the physical/data link layer connectivity.
    2.  **Internet Backbone:** The core high-capacity networks operated by major providers that carry data across continents and oceans.
    3.  **Internet Service Providers (ISPs):** Companies that provide end-users and businesses with access to the internet backbone.
    4.  **Hardware Infrastructure:** Routers, switches, servers, data centers, and end-user devices (computers, smartphones, tablets).
    5.  **Protocols and Standards:** TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, etc., that govern how data is formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received reliably across diverse networks.

**6. Define availability, authentication and authorization. How they can be enforced in e-commerce security? [3+2]**

*   **Definitions:**
    1.  **Availability:** Ensuring that e-commerce systems, data, and services are accessible and operational when needed by authorized users. Protects against disruptions like Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or hardware failures.
    2.  **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access the system. Confirms "who you are" (e.g., username/password, biometrics, security tokens).
    3.  **Authorization:** Determining what actions, resources, or data an authenticated user or system is permitted to access or modify. Defines "what you are allowed to do".

*   **Enforcement in E-commerce Security:**
    1.  **Availability:** Redundant servers/data centers, load balancing, robust network infrastructure, DDoS mitigation services (e.g., Cloudflare), regular backups, disaster recovery plans.
    2.  **Authentication:** Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA - e.g., password + SMS code or authenticator app), CAPTCHAs, digital certificates, biometric verification (fingerprint/facial recognition).
    3.  **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC - assigning permissions based on user roles like 'customer', 'admin'), Access Control Lists (ACLs), least privilege principle (granting only minimum necessary permissions).

**7. What is e-checking? Describe its working mechanism. [2+3]**

*   **E-Checking (Electronic Check):** An e-check is the digital counterpart of a traditional paper check. It uses the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network to electronically debit funds from the payer's checking account and deposit them into the payee's account. It leverages existing bank account infrastructure for online payments.
*   **Working Mechanism:**
    1.  **Authorization:** The payer (customer) provides their bank account details (routing number, account number) and authorization for the specific payment amount to the payee (merchant) during checkout.
    2.  **Transaction Initiation:** The merchant's payment processor formats the transaction details into an ACH file according to NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association) rules.
    3.  **ACH Processing:**
        *   The file is sent to the merchant's bank (Originating Depository Financial Institution - ODFI).
        *   The ODFI forwards the request to an ACH Operator (e.g., Federal Reserve, The Clearing House).
        *   The ACH Operator sorts the transactions and sends the debit request to the payer's bank (Receiving Depository Financial Institution - RDFI).
    4.  **Funds Verification & Transfer:** The RDFI verifies the payer's account has sufficient funds and places a hold (if applicable). On the settlement date (typically 1-3 business days later), funds are debited from the payer's account and credited to the merchant's account via the ACH network.
    5.  **Confirmation:** Both payer and payee receive notification of the completed transaction (e.g., via email or bank statement).

**7. IDS vs. IPS: Differences and Complementary Roles**  
**Answer:**  
**Differences:**  
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** **Monitors** network traffic for threats and **alerts** admins (*passive*).  
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** **Blocks** malicious traffic in real-time (*active*).  

**Complementarity:**  
- **IDS** analyzes traffic patterns, identifies threats, and provides forensic data.  
- **IPS** uses IDS alerts to **automatically block attacks** (e.g., SQL injection).  
**Diagram:**  
```  
[Network Traffic] → [IPS] → [Blocked Threats]  
                  ↓  
[Allowed Traffic] → [IDS] → [Alerts to Admin]
